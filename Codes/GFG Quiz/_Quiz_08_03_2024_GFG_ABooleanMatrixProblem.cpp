A Boolean Matrix Problem

You are given a matrix Mat of m rows and n columns. The matrix is boolean so the elements of the
matrix can only be either 0 or 1.
Now, if any row of the matrix contains a 1, then you need to fill that whole row with 1. After doing
the mentioned operation, you need to print the modified matrix.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow.
The first line of each testcase contains m and n denoting number of rows and number of columns.
Then next m lines contain n elements denoting the elements of the matrix.
Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the modified matrix.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function boolean matrix that takes mat,
m, n as parameters and changes the mat as per the instructions. The printing is done by the driver
code.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= m, n <= 900
Mat âˆˆ {0,1}
Examples:
Input:
2
5 4
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
1 2
0 0
Output:
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
0 0
Explanation:
Testcase1: rows = 5 and columns = 4
The given matrix is
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
Evidently, the first row contains a 1 so fill the whole row with 1. The third row also contains a 1 so
that row will be filled too. Finally, the last row contains a 1 and therefore it needs to be filled with
1 too.
The final matrix is
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
Tescase2: rows = 1 and columns = 2
The given matrix is
0 0
Now, since there is no 1 present so we don't change the matrix.
